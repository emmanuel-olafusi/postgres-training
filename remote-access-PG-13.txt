How to enable remote access to PostgreSQL server


Prerequisites : 

systemctl status firewalld

Overview

When you install PostgreSQL, by default connection to the Postgres by using TCP/IP is not allowed.

Installation steps for postgreSQl-13 on linux


sudo yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install -y postgresql13-server
sudo /usr/pgsql-10/bin/postgresql-13-setup initdb
sudo systemctl enable postgresql-13
sudo systemctl start postgresql-13


Demo setup
***********
IP address        hostname      postgres  Version     Role
**********        **********    ****************     *****
192.168.1.61       linux2          12                Server
192.168.1.71       linux1          12                Client


By default postgres database user who is superuser will not be having any password .

How to set the password

sudo su - postgres

psql
# alter user postgres password 'password';

# psql -U postgres -h 192.168.1.61

When you try to connect Postgres database from a client  using psql command,
you  get “psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused” error message.

-bash-4.2$ psql -U postgres -h 192.168.1.107
psql: error: could not connect to server: Connection refused
Is the server running on host "192.168.1.107" and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
-bash-4.2$


1. Modify pg_hba.conf to add Client Authentication Record

On the PostgreSQL database server, by default, you’ll notice the following records towards the end of the
/var/lib/pgsql/12/data/pg_hba.conf. As indicated below, it accepts connections only from the localhost.

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all         ::1/128               ident
Add the following line to the pg_hba.conf server. This will allow connection from 192.168.1.56

host    all         all         192.168.1.56/24    md5


2. Change the Listen Address in PostgreSQL.conf

On the PostgreSQL database server, by default, the listen address will be localhost in the postgresql.conf file
as shown below.

# grep listen /var/lib/pgsql/12/data/postgresql.conf
listen_addresses = 'localhost'
Modify this line and give IP address of server. If you have multiple interfaces on the server, you can also specify a specific interface to be listened.

Verify updated details.
-bash-4.2$ grep listen /var/lib/pgsql/12/data/postgresql.conf
listen_addresses = '192.168.1.61'               # what IP address(es) to listen on;
-bash-4.2$


3. Restart PostgreSQL server to apply the changes:

systemctl restart postgresql-12
systemctl status postgresql-12

mention pg_ctl

4. Test the Remote Connection

Now, login to the client machine 192.168.1.71, and perform the psql remote connection to the PostgreSQL database server (192.168.1.61) as shown below.

# psql -U postgres -h 192.168.1.107
